# Swift Blackjack Game

A minimalist Blackjack game built with **SwiftUI**, designed to showcase basic state management, UI layout, and gameplay logic. This app demonstrates how to build a turn-based game using modern Swift paradigms like `@StateObject` and reactive updates.

---

## Features

- Hit / Stand gameplay logic
- Dealer AI that draws to 17
- Score display and bust detection
- Reset button to replay instantly
- Clean SwiftUI interface

---

## How It Works

- `BlackjackGame`: Observable class that manages the deck, player and dealer hands, game state, and result messages.
- `BlackjackView`: SwiftUI view that renders the UI, buttons, and score logic.
- Dealer draws automatically until they reach 17+ after you stand.
- The game determines win/loss conditions and updates the view reactively.

## ðŸ› Tech Stack

- `SwiftUI`
- `@StateObject` and `@Published` properties
- Simple MVC structure (`Game`, `View`, `Hand`, `Deck`, etc.)
